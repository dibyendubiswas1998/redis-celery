    "`Redis` is designed to run in trusted environments and should not be exposed directly to the internet. The official documentation states that Redis should be accessed only by trusted clients; exposing the Redis TCP port to untrusted networks can allow remote attackers to delete data or run dangerous commands. Authentication via `requirepass` or Access Control Lists (ACLs) adds a layer of protection by forcing clients to authenticate before sending commands. For durability, Redis provides an **`Append Only File (AOF)`** mechanism: enabling `appendonly yes` records every write operation so the database can rebuild its state on restart.\n",
